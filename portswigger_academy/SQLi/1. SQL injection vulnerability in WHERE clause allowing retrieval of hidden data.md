### Description

This lab contains a [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.

### Solution

1. Click on one of the categories and observe that the url now ends with a `/filter?category=<category>` query
2. Replace the category with a SQLi statement that evaluates to true, like `/filter?category=' OR 1=1 -- 
3. You should see extra results in the webpage, and the lab is solved.
