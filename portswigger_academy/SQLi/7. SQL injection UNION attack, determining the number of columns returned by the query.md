### Description

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack.

To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that returns an additional row containing null values.

### Solution

1. Start by navigating to the page with the product category filter in the url
2. Start with the SQLi query `Pets' UNION SELECT NULL -- -` and see that the server returns an error.
3. Continue adding more "NULL" columns to the SQLi query until you find a number that works.
4. Eventually, one query will work without an error. For me, that was 3 NULL columns: `# Pets' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL -- -`
