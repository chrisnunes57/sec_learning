### Description

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`.

To solve the lab, perform a [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.
### Solution

1. Navigate to the url with the category filter
2. Use the SQLi techniques from last lab to find that there are two columns returned in the query, and only the second one is text.
3. Query the `users` table, using `CONCAT` to return both the username and password in the second column. Use the SQLi payload `Pets' UNION SELECT null, CONCAT(username, ' ~ ', password) FROM users -- -` to list all user credentials
4. Login using the administrator credentials that were just revealed
