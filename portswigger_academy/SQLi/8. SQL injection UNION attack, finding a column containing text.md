### Description

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you first need to determine the number of columns returned by the query. You can do this using a technique you learned in a [previous lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns). The next step is to identify a column that is compatible with string data.

The lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. To solve the lab, perform a [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. This technique helps you determine which columns are compatible with string data.

### Solution

1. Navigate to the product category filter url
2. Discover the number of columns in the query by using the SQLi technique from the previous lab: `Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL -- -`
3. Try replacing every `NULL` in the query with the specified string from the description, and see which column works.
4. It looks like the text column is in the second spot, so solve the lab with the SQLi payload `Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL, '6wWZMw', NULL -- -`
