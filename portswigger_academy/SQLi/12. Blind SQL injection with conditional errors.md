### Description

This lab contains a [blind SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind) vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The results of the SQL query are not returned, and the application does not respond any differently based on whether the query returns any rows. If the SQL query causes an error, then the application returns a custom error message.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the `administrator` user.

To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` user.

### Solution

1. Follow the same steps as the previous lab (11), but this time we need to trigger an error when the SQLi query is true, instead of triggering a DOM difference
2. I wrote a script to solve this one too, in the github repo as "lab_12_solution.py"
